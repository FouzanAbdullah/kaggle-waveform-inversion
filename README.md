# Geophysical Waveform Inversion Competition

This project was built for the [Yale/UNC-CH Geophysical Waveform Inversion Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/waveform-inversion). The goal is to estimate subsurface velocity maps from 3D seismic waveform data using physics-informed machine learning techniques.
